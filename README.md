# CS251---Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-
Some of my coding projects from the spring 2024 semester 


Project 1: Data Analysis and Visualization 
This project focused on achieving the following goals:
  -   Parse and work with numeric and categorical data stored in CSV format.
  -   Handle missing numeric and categorical data.
  -   Perform computations on data based on variable name rather than numeric index.
  -   Get accustomed to numpy's ndarray data type and matplotlib.
  -   Practice writing vectorized code.

Project 4: PCA and Eigenfaces
This project focused on achieving the following goals: 
  -  Explore how fundamental transformations affect data: translation, scaling, rotation, projection.
  -  Analyze and interpret how PCA makes use of transformations to reduce the dimensionality of data.
  -  Visualize principal component projections and explore the meaning of the data representation.
  -  Use visualization to guide decisions about data dimensionality reduction.
  -  Explore two new visualization techniques: elbow plot and loading plot.

    
**NOTE: Unfortunately, the data file for this project was too big to upload, but I believe the files are accessible online. They were called lfwcrop.npy and lfwcrop_ids.txt.
